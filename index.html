<h1>Our History</h1>
</div>
<p>Organic Products India began its quest 20 years back and our aim was crystal clear since the beginning – ‘To become a pioneer of organic across the globe’. The initial phase was tough for us as the Indian market was completely unaware of this concept but we took it upon us to train & educate people about organic products. We constantly kept updating our knowledge to devise the best organic goods for our clientele.

Ours was the first company to venture in the business of manufacturing & trading agricultural products and we also carved a niche in this field by adopting a six-tier approach for Total Quality Management (TQM). Owing to our unique approach to organic farming we have built a solid reputation across the globe as a trustworthy brand.

At present, we are one of the leading manufacturers of organic & conventional seeds, spices, grains, cereals & pulses.
